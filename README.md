# AndroidColorPicker
##### A simple good looking color picker component for Android

A color picker is something that has always been missing from the standard set of components which developers can build their user interface in Android with. This is a color picker which I wrote for one of my own project which I decided to release as open source.

### How to use

For doumentation about how to use the library, check the demo app included in this project.

There are basicly three different ways to use this color picker. You can add it to your preferences using the ColorPreference class. You can also use it as a DialogFragment using the ColorPickerDialogFragment. Or you can simply use the ColorPickerView to add the color picker anywhere you want in you application. All three cases are demonstrated in the demo app, please refer to the demo for more information.
